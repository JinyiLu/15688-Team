The dataset that we are going to use is the IMDb movie reviews (http://www.imdb.com/). We are going to crawl various kinds of useful information from it, such as user ratings, user location, review content, movie popularity, movie genre, cast, etc. We will further analyze the dataset to try to answer several interesting questions, for example what is the most popular movie genre, is there any location bias in terms of movie preference and so on. Finally, we are going to combine all the analysis results together and build a recommendation system to recommend movies to potential users. 

Your feedback from Zico is: 

This is good, though a bit broad in scope. There's a lot of work on collaborative filtering for movie recommendations, and it would be good to focus on a concrete problem like whether there are a handful of user features that can be added to a data set to improve performance over "naive" methods like matrix factorization based just upon reviews.
