It's launched in 1990 by computer programmer Col Needham. As of September 2016, IMDb has approximately 3.9 million titles (including episodes) and 7.4 million personalities in its database, as well as 67 million registered users. [*From Wikipedia*]\n",

Code for data collection can be found at [Data Collection Code]( https://github.com/JinyiLu/15688-Team/blob/master/doc/DataCollection.md). Data can be found at [Data]()\n",
